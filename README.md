# amitj.me — Portfolio of Amit Joshi

A cinematic dark portfolio for a Solution Architect working at the intersection of AWS cloud infrastructure and GenAI. Scroll-driven storytelling on the surface, a fully working retro terminal underneath (press `~`).

## 🚀 About This Portfolio

The site presents 10+ years of experience in DevOps, AWS cloud architecture, and GenAI:
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS Expert with APN Advanced Partner, AWS GenAI & DevOps Competencies
- **DevOps Engineering**: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD
- **GenAI Integration**: 10+ production LLM solutions, 40% performance improvement, 50% cost reduction
- **Team Leadership**: Grew teams from 5 to 25+ engineers
- **Compliance**: HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS compliant system design

## 🎯 Features

- **Cinematic redesign**: dark "mission control" theme, phosphor green + amber accents, GSAP-orchestrated hero entrance and scroll choreography
- **Living constellation background**: canvas-drawn architecture diagram (nodes, edges, data pulses) with pointer parallax
- **Retro terminal easter egg**: the original interactive CLI lives on as a summonable overlay (`~` key, nav button, or `/?cmd=<command>` deep link) — all commands, easter eggs, and history intact
- **AI Assistant (oneai)**: chat panel + terminal command, backed by a Pinecone RAG proxy
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: installable, offline-capable, service-worker cached
- **Accessible & resilient**: semantic HTML readable without JavaScript, `prefers-reduced-motion` alternatives, WCAG AA contrast
- **Comprehensive content**: experience timeline, featured projects, skills, LinkedIn recommendations, articles, talks, certifications
- **Melbourne clock**: real-time local timezone in the hero and terminal

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3 (OKLCH color), Vanilla JavaScript — no build step
- **Motion**: GSAP + ScrollTrigger + Lenis (vendored locally)
- **Typography**: Bricolage Grotesque + Fragment Mono (VT323 in terminal mode)
- **PWA**: Service Worker, Web App Manifest
- **AI Integration**: oneai assistant backed by Pinecone vector store (RAG)
- **Data**: JSON-based content management + Markdown CV
- **SEO**: Sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD structured data
- **Security**: .well-known/security.txt, HTTPS-only PWA
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain (amitj.me)
